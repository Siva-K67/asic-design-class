Lab 1A
Write the C code in a file in ubuntu terminal and save it as sum.c (source code)
Next, compile the source code using gcc compiler, this will generate the executable code.
Now, run the executable code to see the output.

Lab 1B
Compiling a C program with RISCV gcc compiler, execute it, generate the output 
Now, compile the sum.c using RISCV gcc compiler, also see the assembly code for C program.

The object code dump generates main function at location 10184 and 15 instructions are present in assembly code.
Next, we try 0fast of RISCV compiler for same C code and observe the object code dump, now the main function is located at 100b0 and number of instructions is 12.
